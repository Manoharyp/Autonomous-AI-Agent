Autonomous AI Agent
ðŸš€ An Autonomous AI Agent that executes tasks based on instructions without human intervention.

Features
Finds the latest AI headlines and saves them to a file.

Autonomous decision-making with modular agents (Browser, File, Terminal).

Simple and efficient architecture.

How It Works
Input Instruction:
The agent takes an instruction (e.g., "Find top 5 AI headlines and save to file").

Autonomous Execution:
Based on the instruction, the agent selects the right module (browser, file, terminal) to complete the task.

Output Result:
Results are saved into output/result.txt automatically.
